# algorithms-in-go
This is a repo full of misc. algorithms that I've coded in Go.

# why
My undergraduate degree was in Math and I didn't learn these fundamental CS algorithms while in school. 
Life-long learning for the win.

# help me
Feedback is appreciated. We are all sometimes noobs in life, but me more than others.
